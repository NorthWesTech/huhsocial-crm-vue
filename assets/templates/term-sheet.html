                <h4>Invoices:</h4>

                <p>In order to be issued with the shares detailed below, you will need to raise an invoice to Lanistar
                    as
                    detailed in the Fee and/or Referral Bonus section of your agreement. Raising the invoice accurately
                    is
                    important to ensure we can issue you the shares you are entitled to.</p>

            </main>
        </section>
        <div style="page-break-after:always"></div>
        <section class="pdf-page">
            <main>

                <h6>When should you raise your invoice?</h6>

                <p>Your invoice for the Fee should be raised on signing your Ambassador Agreement with us Your invoice
                    for
                    the Referral Bonus should be raised once the relevant influencer has been engaged by Lanistar for 6
                    months (further details below).</p>

                <h6>How much should your invoice be for?</h6>

                <p>For the Fee:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>[&pound;100]</li>
                </ul>

                <p>For the Referral Bonus, Lanistar will notify you how many shares you are to receive &ndash; please
                    issue
                    an invoice for &pound;0.01 x the number of shares.</p>

                <h3>Fee Payment:</h3>

                <p>Payment of the above invoice for your Fee is by the issue of &lsquo;B&rsquo; shares in Lanistar
                    Limited
                    at their nominal value. Each share has a nominal value of &pound;0.01, therefore 100 shares will be
                    issued for each &pound;1 of your invoice. For example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>for an invoice for a Fee of &pound;100&nbsp;- 10,000&nbsp;shares will be issued</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Based on a potential 5 Billion total valuation of Lanistar Limited each of the shares received would
                    be
                    worth &pound;12.50 (E.g 10,000 shares x &pound;12.50 = &pound;125,000)</p>
                <h3>Referral Bonus Payment:</h3>

                <p>If you introduce influencers to Lanistar, Lanistar may, in its discretion, award certain &#39;C&#39;
                    shares In Lanistar Limited to you. The issue of such shares is subject to you introducing any number
                    of
                    influencers to Lanistar, who Lanistar (at its discretion) chooses to engage and only where those
                    influencers continue to work with Lanistar for at least 6 months. We will keep you updated on
                    whether we
                    engage influencers you introduce to us. If we sign an agreement with them, we will let you know the
                    start date.</p>

                    Referral
                    Bonus section of your agreement. The additional shares will be a different class of shares to those
                    issued for the Fee; these will be &lsquo;C&rsquo; shares. The number of &#39;C&#39; shares to be
                    issued
                    will be determined by Lanistar who will consider the number and nature of influencers introduced.
